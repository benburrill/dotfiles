# ~/.shrc -- Configuration for limited POSIX shells
# This file is only read by shells that use $ENV for configuration.
# These are generally very minimalistic shells which I have no intent on
# ever using as my primary shell.
# An alternative vision for this file would be configuration common to
# all shells I use, but I don't want to worry about being compatible
# with all POSIX shells and also I pretty much only use bash anyway.

# When bash is invoked as `sh`, it reads from $ENV, but still stores
# history to the bash history file.  This means that unless my history
# settings are configured somewhere other then .bashrc, the bash history
# file will be truncated!  Since I currently want to configure all my
# history settings in my bashrc (some of them use shopt, and are thus
# bash-only), I disable history persistence here to avoid truncation.
unset HISTFILE
# Be verbose to ensure that no shells read from $ENV that I don't expect
echo History persistence disabled
