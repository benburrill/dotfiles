# Zenity gui for my symlink-gardener tool
# I add the zengarden commands as file manager actions, which I find
# results in a very pleasant UX.
# Mostly I'm just happy with the name though.

# ~requires zenity

# TODO: in the future maybe add more commands, like plant and prune
# Adding plant would require a file selection window, either to select
# the package or to select the garden, and I'm not sure which would be
# better.  Selecting the package makes more sense on principal, but I
# think I'd prefer to select the garden since I probably would be using
# it from a file manager to install a specific package.
