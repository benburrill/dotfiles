# Git uses $SSH_ASKPASS for both usernames and passwords.  In KDE, this
# means popping open a window with a password field asking me for a
# username, which is annoying and confusing.  Since there doesn't seem
# to be any git-kwallet integration apart from through $SSH_ASKPASS, I
# do want to use askpass, just not for usernames.  This script fails
# with a non-zero status when the prompt contains "Username" or if
# $SSH_ASKPASS isn't set, which causes git to fallback to prompting
# through the terminal.  It also causes an error message to appear,
# which isn't ideal, but otherwise I would need to re-implement
# git_terminal_prompt, but with more limited information about whether
# git _actually_ wants to echo.
